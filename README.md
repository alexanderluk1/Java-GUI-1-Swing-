# Java_GUI_1_Swing
This repo is a small project of exploring and learning about the basics of Java Swing

## This project involves using 

1. Java Swing
2. JFrame, JPanel, JLabels, JTextField, JButtons, JOptionPane
3. BufferedReader (To Read file)

## Summary of this project:

1. User will load CSV file using the Load Button (BufferedReader will read and store values into an ArrayList)
2. If there is any error loading the file, a JOptionPane will display appropriate error message. Load button will then be disabled
3. Previous and Next buttons will cycle through the different Quotations via the ArrayList
4. Previous and Next buttons will be disabled and enabled accordingly (I.e. Next button disabled at the final Quotation)
